About Critter Caller Light
--------------------------

Critter Caller Light will automatically call a non-combat pet whenever you don't 
already have one.

Using Critter Caller Light
--------------------------

No setup is required to start using Critter Caller Light. If at any time you
don't have a pet out, then the next time you walk forward then one of your 
pets will automatically be summoned.  This will happen unless you are mounted, 
flying or in combat.
Rare pets are much more likely to be summoned. Summon rates can not be configured 
through the UI, although limited configurability is available by editing the saved 
variables file.

The /ccall command
------------------

Critter Caller Light lets you type the following commands into the chat window:

/ccall summon
Summons another pet.

/ccall dismiss
Dismiss your current pet.

/ccall disable
Stops summoning pets.

/ccall enable
Allows pets to be summoned again.

Summon and dismiss can also be bound to keys in the key binding interface.

Differences from Critter Caller
-------------------------------
The original Critter Caller had an interface that let you set the chance of 
summoning individual pets, and also let you create profiles that summoned
different pets in each area. This did not scale well to large numbers of pets.

New features will no longer be added to the original Critter Caller.
